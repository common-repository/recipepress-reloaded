The swiss army knife for your food blog. A tool to add nicely formatted recipes that are SEO friendly to your blog and to manage your recipe collection.


== Description ==

RecipePress Reloaded is a powerful and very flexible tool to manage your blog's recipe collection. It was designed with the editor in mind and created for easy and fast usage.
This plugin adds a new post type for recipes to your website. You can publish your recipes as standalone posts, or include in your normal posts and pages.
Organize your recipes in any way you would like. It includes predefined food categories such as cuisines, courses, seasons and difficulties. As creating new categories is
easy it's up to you which and how many categories you will are creating. Use index pages embedded on pages to make your recipes accessible by title or taxonomy terms. Or use one of
the widgets to create tag clouds or top ten lists.
Of course, you can use all the other WordPress goodies you know from posts in your recipes as well: photos, videos and comments. We have also included new additions such as user 5-star reviews and recipe process shots.
Despite its simplicity it's giving editors, administrators, designers and developers all the freedom to adapt the plugin to their needs. Features you don't
need can be deactivated and are hidden from the UI. You can even create your own recipe templates to complete control the look and feel of your recipes. The default ones
are SEO friendly, with support for Google's JSON-LD recipe schema information.


= Features =

* custom post type for recipes
* backend to enter recipes fast
* group ingredients and instructions to sets, e.g., for cake and topping
* add process shots to each step of the recipe instruction if you like
* all the extra metadata such as diet type or recipe source you need for recipes
* user submitted 5-star ratings for recipes, with your complete control
* serving size
* preparation and cooking times
* nutritional information
* all taxonomies you need. Cuisines, courses, seasons and difficulties come predefined, but you can create whatever taxonomy you like.
* use post categories and terms on recipes as well, but only if you want to
* ingredients are a taxonomy as well, so you can easily find all recipes using 'carrots' for example.
* access recipes by alphabetical indices of title or any taxonomy term
* include recipes to your normal posts or pages using shortcodes
* search engine friendly recipe output using [Google's](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe) recipe JSON-LD format
* choose between different templates to determine how your recipes should look like or create your own template yourself
